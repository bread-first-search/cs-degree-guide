# Readme

## Welcome
The purpose of this guide is to democratize the CS degree. It aims to demystify and provide learning materials to those who are learning, but not going through formal education, to inform those considering formal education what they're getting themselves into, and to provide extra materials to students who are currently in a CS program. It is assumed that those using the guide are interested in a career in industry vs academia, and want to gain knowledge on the breadth of material a formal degree provides.

You don't need a degree to become an engineer or get into tech, you just need some discipline and curiousity. However, it can be hard to know what to study, or where to start, espeically if you want to cover some "traditional" material like algorithm complexity analysis when you're self-teaching.

## Format
This guide will go over courses that are commonly found in a CS baccalaureate curriculum. It will then discuss common content and objectives of each course, resources & strategies for learning that content, some example projects big and small to help you learn, and what you should take away from the course as it pertains to an industry career. It is crucial to provide readers context on why certain things are more or less important, and what they mean for real world engineering.

## Contributing
I am accepting PRs! Currently the guide is very rough and in draft stages, but I would love
- more helpful resources
- industry insight on classes/ contextualizing coursework
- information about courses that you took that I didn't (like the compilers class example in the courses readme)
- probably a load of other stuff too
