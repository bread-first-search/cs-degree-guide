# Electives readme

When I talk about electives here, I'm talking about CS-specific elective courses. Some schools require CS students to pick some other engineering electives, and during my first baccalaureate program, in addition to major electives we had to select 2 upper division electives (I chose anthropolgy clsses for both). As part of a baccalaureate program, you may encounter lots of types of elective courses, but here we are focusing on Computer Science topics.

Electives vary widely from school to school. These aren't subjects that you need to know to be an engineer, but they can help you explore a focus and if the class is good, get an interesting portfolio project.

These are typically easier in intensity than a core curriculum class, and are focused on being a broad survey of the given subject. Think of them as a helpful jumping off point!
