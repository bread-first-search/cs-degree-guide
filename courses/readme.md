# Courses

Courses here are represented by their being part of the 'core' curriculum, or electives. Different programs have different requirements and curricula. The goal here is to capture the most relevant things (basically I'm not including things like calculus, but am including discrete math/discrete structures), and also to represent a breadth of experiences. Because of that, you will see a much larger number of courses here than is found in the core curriculum of any given program. For example, my curriculum did not include a compilers course, but many programs do.


## Curricula
Here is a handy list, for the curious, of different CS curricula at different universities:
    - San Jose State
    - UCLA
    - CalTech
    - Stanford
    - Oregon State online post-baccalaureate (my alma mater)
    
The couses are listed in this repo in alphabetical order. Take a look at the above curricula to get an idea of what order programs expect students to take their course in!

Please feel free to add your own!

## Textbooks
Some of these courses have textbooks. You may find them helpful, you may not. If you are interested in using one of them, PDFs of older or international editions of the mentioned book are often quite easy to find for free! If you really want a hard copy, older or international editions are still just fine. A used textbook one or two versions behind is usually $30 or so.

## Language choice
Here is a wall of text, because I know this is something new coders and engineers get stuck on! 

In the university setting, C and C++ are a popular language choice. There are many reasons for that, including that learning C/C++ from the get-go makes learning an assembly language easier, and it means you don't have to learn a new language to work with operating systems at a low-level. An emerging language being taught in University settings is Python. This is a much higher-level language and so it is easier to write in. There are some careers and engineering specialties that require working in C or C++, but most general purpose software jobs do not, and use something higher-level instead. Python, for example, is used very widely across the industry. For that reason, I will present each course that can be language-agnostic in both C/C++ and Python. 

My honest advice about language choice is that I recommend jumping around. Language is less important than learning, what's important now is learning to think programmatically. That can happen for some people by learning with a very low level language, and for others with a high level language. The language isn't programming itself, but a way to articulate instructions about what you want the computer to do. Learning what you want to articulate to solve a problem is the goal when learning to code. 

See what you like, see what feels comfortable, and as you learn, think abour what kind of software specialties you might like to explore which might influence language exploration. For example, the data structures class I took was in C. I *like* C, but felt that I didn't have a solid understanding of each data structure until I played with them in Python and could iterate really quickly. On the other hand, C was really handy for some malware analysis I did in another class. I didn't have to learn it, I was already comfortable! One language isn't more real or hardcore or whatever the kids are calling it these days. They each have their pros, cons, and intended applications. All are legitmate choices for learning and working with. Just "C" what works for you ;)
