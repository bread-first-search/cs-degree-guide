# Introduction to Computer Science I

## Prerequisites
None

## Couse Objective
The intention of this course is to give students a foundation of the basics of coding, such that they will have something to work from in later classes. After taking Intro I and Intro II, you will "know how to code", and everything else after that is refining your technique, exploring different focus areas, introductions to other disciplines, and exploring problem solving strategies. 

Choices in language and assignment type will depend on what the designer best thinks will prepare students for course later in that particular program. Since we're not doing a formal program here, I'll show you a little bit of everything. 

Here is a course description from UCLA's course catalog: 
>Introduction to computer science via theory, applications, and programming. Basic data types, operators and control structures. Input/output. Procedural and data abstraction. Introduction to object-oriented software development. Functions, recursion. Arrays, strings, pointers. Abstract data types, object-oriented programming. Examples and exercises from computer science theory and applications

So we're going to learn some programming basics including
- data types 
- control flow
- making and calling functions 
- abstraction
- object oriented programming.  

That might not mean anything yet, but it will!

## Learning Resources
If you're starting out from square 1, and you've never coded before, I recommend an online course. There is *a lot* to take in at the very beginning, and having a guide to help you through getting an environment set up and running your code is a big relief. 

### Textbooks
Here are some textbooks used by some courses:
- *Absolute C++*
- *Starting out with C++*
- *Starting out with Python*

### Online courses
These are solid foundational courses. Take one, take them all, or not. Moving on to a "subject" class like networks or databases will be possible after something like this
